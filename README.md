This PHP-based website provides users with a simple way to create and download a personalized profile image with their details. The process is straightforward: visitors enter their contact information, name, and a position number representing their new role. They then upload a profile picture, which the system seamlessly integrates into a custom-designed template.

Once submitted, the backend processes the data by:
- Storing user details securely
- Embedding the uploaded profile image and contact information into the template.

Finally, the website generates a downloadable version of the completed image, allowing users to save and share their personalized profile. This tool is ideal for creating quick, branded images for professional and social media use.
